## 🐍 Python Fundamentals

This section contains notebooks covering the core concepts of Python for data science.

-   **Topics covered:** Basic syntax, strings, operators, input/output, control flow (`if/else`, `match/case`), loops, data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries), list comprehensions, lambda functions, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics.

---

## 📊 Data Analysis Libraries

Notebooks dedicated to learning the essential libraries for numerical computation and data manipulation.

### NumPy

-   **Topics covered:** Creating NumPy arrays, data types, indexing and slicing, broadcasting, multidimensional arrays, and mathematical functions.

### Pandas

-   **Topics covered:** Core data structures (Series, DataFrame), creating DataFrames, and methods for data selection and filtering.

## 📂 Projects

Here I apply my skills to real-world scenarios.

### Project 1

-   **Description:** A project focused on data wrangling. It involves reading raw JSON data (`data.json`, `data2.json`), performing data cleaning, and saving the cleaned result (`cleaned_data2.json`). The analysis likely explores relationships within the data, as suggested by the `people_you_may_know.ipynb` notebook.
-   **Files:** `01_introduction.ipynb`, `02_data_cleaning.ipynb`, `03_people_you_may_know.ipynb`, `04_pages_you_might_like.ipynb`.
